## About OStag Project
This projects aims to provide a open-source IC design for a simple backscatter tag called OStag. The design goal is to make a backscatter tag low-power and low-cost. It can be labelled as a research project for IoT, mobile computing and networking. All of its analog part will be open-source, that's important for the research community. The development will be in three stages:
* Digital IC design and simulation. Verfications for the baseband.
* Analog IC design and simulation. Verfications for the passive circuits and oscillators.
* Integration and final release.
